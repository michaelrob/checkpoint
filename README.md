### CheckPoint

Tool for checking and validating data from api endpoints.

Currently this will display data returned from an endpoint and allow you to validate
against an XSD file.

## Tasks

* Recon checker tool should be more generic (should pull data from XSD + be able to send custom XML)
* Clean up Validation tool (design doesn't work, make better use of bootstrap)
