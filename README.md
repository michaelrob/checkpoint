## Checkpoint

Checkpoint, an application for debugging and testing REST apis. I mostly started this project to help with some stuff I 
was doing at work. And I rebooted it so I could get back into Groovy.

### Installation

Checkpoint uses Gradle as its build manager.

1. Run `gradle build`

2. Because we're using the `spring-boot-gradle-plugin` plugin we can use the following: `gradle bootrun`

If you're using default settings, the site is hosted at `localhost:8080`.
